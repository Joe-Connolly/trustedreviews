TODO: short project description, some sample screenshots or mockups

*Trusted Reviews* is a review-posting platform that offers a secure database of verified customer reviews and testimonials. Registered users can add to, view, and vote on a filterable/searchable list of product reviews. Retailers can access these reviews through a secure API that embeds consistently-styled and verified reviews within their websites.

## Architecture

The backend of this app is a mongoDB database using mongoose for schema-based models and Heroku for deployment.
